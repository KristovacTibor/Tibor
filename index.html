			<p><span style="font-size:55px;">W</span>eb development comes with a huge set of rules and techniques every website developer should know about. If you want a website to look and function as you wish them to, you need to get familiar with web technologies that will help you achieve your goal.

And while it sounds quite complicated, once you know what you are doing, understanding web technology and the way it works becomes much easier than it looks.			
			Since computers can not communicate with each other the way people do, they require codes instead. Web technologies are the markup languages and multimedia packages computers use to communicate.
			Browsers request information and then they show us in the way we can understand. Think of them as the translator of the web.

			<p>One of the most popular browsers would be Google Chrome, but there are a lots of browsers you can chose from! Such as Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer.
