			<h2> Basics about Hypertext Markup Language</h2>
			<p><span style="font-size:35px;">H</span>TML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another.
			</p>
			<p>
			<span style="font-size:35px;">H</span>TML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that your Internet browser may display them as they are intended to look. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its appearance.
			</p>
			<p>
			<span style="font-size:35px;">M</span>ost HTML tags have an opening tag containing the tag name, tag attributes, a closing tag containing a forward slash, and the tag name being closed. For tags that do not have a closing tag like < img >, it is best practice to end the tag with a forward slash.
			</p>
			<p>
			<span style="font-size:35px;">E</span>ach tag is contained within a less than and greater than angle brackets, and everything between the opening and closing tag is displayed or affected by the tag. In the example on the left side of the screen, the < a > tag is creating a link called "Hello World" that is pointing to the hope.html file.
